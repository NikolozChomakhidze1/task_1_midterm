1.Understanding the package structure: At first, I wasn’t sure where to place the ms.md and other important files like Photo.java, PhotoManager.java, and others. After thinking through the project structure, I figured out that these files needed to be organized in the root folder and adjusted them accordingly. Troubles with filtering photos in the searchPhotosByTag method: I initially had difficulty properly filtering photos based on their tags. I addressed this by carefully revisiting the logic and ensuring the method correctly iterates through the photos and checks each tag in the list. Issues with importing packages: While working with provided classes like A21 and A22, I ran into some complications around package access. I solved this by reviewing the correct structure of the classes and adding necessary getter methods for proper access.


2.The use of AI tools significantly helped me clarify some Java concepts that were new to me during the exam:
Learning about Java Collections: I gained a better understanding of working with List, ArrayList, and iterating through collections. I had some initial confusion on handling List<String> for tags in the Photo class, and with a little guidance, I was able to understand the syntax and best practices for working with these collections.
Implementing the searchPhotosByTag method: When I struggled with the logic of filtering photos based on their tags, I was able to get a clearer idea of how to correctly filter and iterate through objects. This was useful when I needed to check if a list of tags contained a specific tag. Improving code documentation: I also received help with structuring and writing better comments and documentation for the code. This made the final implementation easier to understand and more readable. AI tools helped streamline these tasks, especially when I wasn’t sure about specific syntax or how to implement certain features. It saved time and helped me focus on the logic and implementation.


3. Cases Where AI Was Not Fully Helpful
Although AI was a helpful resource, there were a few occasions when it didn’t fully meet my expectations:
Package import errors: While AI suggested ways to handle package imports, there were moments when its suggestions didn’t entirely address how to manage access modifiers (like private fields) between classes. I had to figure out the best way to manage this by adding getter methods manually. Complex method suggestions: In some cases, AI recommended methods that felt overly complicated for the task at hand. For example, it suggested creating unnecessary helper methods. I ultimately simplified the code by relying on my own understanding of the logic instead of following the AI's suggestions verbatim.

Conclusion:
Overall, AI tools were a valuable aid in speeding up my learning process during the exam. Even though I faced a few challenges, combining the AI support with my knowledge helped me work through them. By using both, I was able to grasp concepts more quickly, especially in areas like Java collections, object-oriented design, and code structuring.
